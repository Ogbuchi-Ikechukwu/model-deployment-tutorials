## IPython notebooks for deployment of various computer vision models on edge devices.

In this repository we will continuously post IPython notebooks with training and deployment of several neural network models on edge devices. Notebooks are originally written and tested in Google Colab. So if you are looking for a plug and play Google Colab is the way to go.
&nbsp;  
We strongly encourage the community to open pull requests and share with us their deployment pipeplines on edge devices in the form of IPython notebooks.
